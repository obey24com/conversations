        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Rise of Neural Machine Translation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The landscape of language translation has been dramatically transformed by the advent of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Unlike traditional rule-based systems, NMT uses deep learning to understand context and nuance, producing more natural and accurate translations.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Real-Time Translation Capabilities</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Modern AI translation systems can now process and translate speech in real-time, breaking down language barriers in live conversations. This technology has revolutionized international business, tourism, and cross-cultural communication.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Context-Aware Translation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          One of the most significant advances in AI translation is the ability to understand context. Modern systems can now recognize idioms, cultural references, and maintain consistency across long documents, providing translations that feel natural to native speakers.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Future of AI Translation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated translation capabilities. From improved handling of regional dialects to better understanding of cultural nuances, the future of language translation is bright.
