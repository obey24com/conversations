        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Beyond Word-for-Word Translation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Effective translation goes beyond simple word substitution. It requires understanding cultural contexts, idioms, and social norms that vary across different societies. Modern AI translation systems are increasingly capable of capturing these nuances.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Cultural Intelligence in Translation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Cultural intelligence is crucial in translation. AI systems are now being trained to recognize cultural references, adapt tone based on cultural context, and provide explanatory notes when direct translation might miss important cultural nuances.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Facilitating Global Understanding</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Advanced translation technology is breaking down barriers that have historically separated cultures. By providing accurate, culturally-aware translations, these tools are fostering better understanding and communication across cultural boundaries.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Future of Cross-Cultural Communication</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As AI translation technology continues to evolve, we can expect even better handling of cultural nuances and context. This will lead to more natural and culturally appropriate translations, further bridging the gap between different cultures.
